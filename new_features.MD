# Creating Multiplication Feature

Created multi2vals.py to accept 2 floats or integers from user input, multiply them and print the answer to the screen

- User is prompted to enter the first number
- If user enter a number, the user is prompted to enter the second number
- If user enters a non-number character, the user is given two more chances before the user is given a notice that the maximum numbe of attempts has been exceeded and the programme closes
